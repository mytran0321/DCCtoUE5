# DCC TO UE5 WORKFLOW METHODS

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

I did some extended research on different methods of importation and exportation for UE5. Most of these are catered to Blender, though the Datasmith method is used for 3DS Max. The goal was find a straightforward and nondestructive workflow; we wanted it to be easy for re-importing instanced static meshes, without breaking any linkages. It would be ideal to make changes to a mesh, and then transfer the static mesh to UE5 without the materials being broken. The options for this are below.
